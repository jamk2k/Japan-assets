# Conditionals

The `なら`, `たら` and `ば` forms can both be used to mean `if A, then B`. The conditional `と` particle can also be used for the same purpose.

* The `ば`-form is used more often for facts: `B` _will_ happen if `A` does.
* You can't use uncertainties with `ば` e.g. たぶん
* `たら` vs `なら` is more in how these are formed. The former is made from the past form, while the latter comes from the verb `なる`. The former is thus `when A has happened` while the latter is `when A will happen`.

# And

`や-など`, `とか`,`と`, `たり`, `て` and `し` can all be used to say `and`

* `や-など` used to say `and` between nouns. It's non **non-exhaustive**
* `とか` is the informal `や` it's also **non-exhaustive**
* `たり` is ``や-など` for verbs: events are **non-exhaustive**
* `と` is used to say `and` **without order**, but **exhaustive**
* `し` is more like `furthermore`, it's **non-exhaustive**
* The `て` form is used to say `and` with **order** **exhaustively**

# Nomalization

`のが` and `こと` can both be used to nomalize. The former is rather for concrete topics, while the latter is used for for abstract concepts.

# あります

`ことがあります` vs `てあります` the former is used to say that something was ever done. The latter is used to say something has been done.

# Potential

There is no real difference between `ことができます` and the potential form.

# Looks like

The difference between `みたい` and `～そうです` is that the latter is based on your own thoughts and senses (e.g. something looks good) (= `it looks like`) and the former is based on your observation (e.g. someones eating eagerly, so it must be tasty) (= `it seems like`).

# Totally

The difference between `ぜったい` and `きっと` or `かならず` is that the former is mostly used in a **negative** context, while the others are used in a **positive** context.
